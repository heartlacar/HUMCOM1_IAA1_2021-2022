    After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, 
    the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe.
    After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins due to the efforts of the Mad Titan, 
    Thanos. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers must assemble once more in order to undo Thanos's 
    actions and undo the chaos to the universe, no matter what consequences may be in store, and no matter who they face...                  
    The grave course of events set in motion by Thanos, that wiped out half the universe and fractured the Avengers ranks, compels the 
    remaining Avengers to take one final stand in Marvel Studios' grand conclusion to twenty-two films - Avengers: Endgame.                   
    After half of all life is snapped away by Thanos, the Avengers are left scattered and divided. Now with a way to reverse the damage, 
    the Avengers and their allies must assemble once more and learn to put differences aside in order to work together and set things right. 
    Along the way, the Avengers realize that sacrifices must be made as they prepare for the ultimate final showdown with Thanos, 
    which will result in the heroes fighting the biggest battle they have ever faced.                                      
    Catastrophe. Confusion. Loss. The overwhelming devastation caused by the mad Titan Thanos has left what remains of the Avengers reeling. 
    For a while, all hope seems lost...until an opportunity to reverse the damage is presented. Now, 
    the team must assemble once more and do whatever it takes to restore the universe and bring those they lost back.

    Scott has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He's now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother and spends his days smoking weed, hanging with the guys - Oscar, Igor and Richie - and secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey. But when his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter named Ray, it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life.
