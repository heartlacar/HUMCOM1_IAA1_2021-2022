</header>
<br>
<p>
    When I get bored and I mean really bored I like to go and see movies and TV series. 
    I like to see are action oriented such as "The Avengers" or "Game of Thrones" to name a few. 
    I really get pumped up and excited when going inside the movie theater because it is a big enough place where I 
    can enjoy a really good movie. I usually order some buttered popcorn and drink a large coca-cola beverage. 
    I would then sit down at the highest point of the seats so I can see the big screen and not get blown away by the sounds. 
    Yes the theater would show some advertisements to get people interested in buying what they are selling. 
    I am just then pumped for the movie that I am going to see. I really like seeing movies since they are always filled with interest that persuades me to see the movie.

    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">Game of Thrones</h1>
    <p>Game of Thrones is an HBO series that tells the story of a medieval country's civil war. 
        The series, which premiered in April 2011, is set on the fictional continents of Westeros 
        and Essos in a world where seasons stretch on for years. When the story begins, 
        a decade-long summer is ending, and winter looms as characters battle to claim the "Iron Throne,"
         the seat of the king of the Seven Kingdoms, the regime that rules all but the northern tip of Westeros. 
         In show parlance, "sit on the Iron Throne" is a metonym equivalent to "rule Westeros."</p>
        <p>The story told in Game of Thrones was adapted by series writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss from George R. R. 
            Martin's fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin published the first book of the series, Game of Thrones, 
            in 1996. The book was originally intended to be the first part of a trilogy, each following one of the three major 
            plot lines, but as Martin wrote, the story expanded into what he now expects to be a seven-book series.</p>
            <h3>Casted By:</h3>
            <p>The show has an ensemble cast that includes Peter Dinklage —
                 who won an Emmy for his role as Tyrion Lannister — Lena Headey, 
                 Natalie Dormer, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Aidan Gillen, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Charles Dance, and Maisie Williams.</p>
                 <h3>Summary</h3>
                 <p>Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros, while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.
                    In the mythical continent of Westeros, several powerful families fight for control of the Seven Kingdoms. As conflict erupts in the 
                    kingdoms of men, an ancient enemy rises once again to threaten them all. Meanwhile, the last heirs of a recently usurped dynasty plot 
                    to take back their homeland from across the Narrow Sea.
                    Years after a rebellion spurred by a stolen bride to be and the blind ambitions of a mad King, Robert of the house Baratheon (Mark Addy)
                     sits on the much desired Iron Throne. In the mythical land of Westeros, nine noble families fight for every inch of control 
                     and every drop of power. The King's Hand, Jon Arryn (Sir John Standing), is dead. And Robert seeks out his only other ally in all of Westeros, 
                     his childhood friend Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark. The solemn and honorable Warden of the North is tasked to depart his frozen sanctuary and 
                     join the King in the capital of King's Landing to help the now overweight and drunk Robert rule. However, a letter in the dead of night informs 
                     "Ned" that the former Hand was murdered, and that Robert will be next. So noble Ned goes against his better desires in an attempt to save 
                     his friend and the kingdoms. But political intrigue, plots, murders, and sexual desires lead to a secret that could tear the Seven Kingdoms apart. 
                     And soon Eddard will find out what happens when you play the Game of Thrones.</p>
