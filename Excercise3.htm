<br>
<div></div>
<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Materials</h3>
<p>
    You'll need some fake flowers from the craft store, green floral tape, wire cutters,
     and a pen (or however many you're looking to make!). If you’re looking to make a bouquet
      or give a variety to different people, it’s best to buy a bulk pack of cheap pens are 
      your local dollar store.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cut the flower stems to 1.5 inches</h3>
<p> If your fake flower has a wire in it, use a wire 
    cutter to clip it or it may be brittle enough to just
     wiggle back and forth and break.</p>

     <ol>
     <li type = "circle">If there are leaves attached to the stem of your fake flower, 
         you can cut them off with scissors or keep some for your desired effect. 
         Leaves can easily be pulled off the main stem or cut off but be sure to 
         leave a bit of stem at the end of the leaves if you plan on wrapping them 
         back up into a bouquet.</li>
        </ol>
         <h3>Step 3: Take out the ink cartridge</h3>

         <p> Before cutting the ink cartridge, measure
              how deep you want to place your flower 
              stem and leaves. Using your wire cutters or sharp 
              scissors, cut off about 1 inch from the ink cartridge 
              (long enough for the flower stem to fit after it in the pen).</p>

              <h3>Step 4: Wrap any extra leaves with the stem of your fake flower.</h3>
              <p>Using green floral tape, make sure you wrap any leaves with your fake 
                  flower stem as tightly as possible to ensure that they will fit down 
                  the shaft of the pen.</p>

                  <ol>
                   <li type = "circle"> If you want to include a lot of leaves 
                    or the shaft of the pen is too small to fit 
                    the wrapped flower stem, you can also use 
                    the green floral tape to tape the flower stems 
                    outside the shaft of the pen. The green floral tape 
                    will be wrapped along the entire shaft regardless 
                    where you place the flower stems. </li>
                  </ol>

                  <h3>Step 5: Put the ink cartridge back and stick the flower stem in after it. </h3>
                  <p>
                    Use scissors or the wire cutter to adjust the length of either the ink
                     cartridge or flower stem. You may also place the tape flush against the
                      pen as you wrap tape to bind them together. Hold the bottom of the pen 
                      to make sure your wrap is as snug as possible.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Step 6: Starting at the top, near the flower, wrap the green tape around until you hit the tip of the pen.</h3>
                  <p>
                    Tape slowly and make sure to tape over the drop of the stem 
                    to create the illusion of a single stem. Keep a consistent 
                    wrap pattern as you make your way downward. Also, be sure 
                    to keep your wrap as tight as possible as you cover any sign 
                    of the pen shaft.
                  </p>

                      <li>If you have the time and skill, you may also attempt 
                          a pattern with your stem wrap. For example, you can 
                          create a zig zag or layers of parallel lines.</li>
                          <li>Use double sided tape if you find that your floral tape is not sticky enough.</li>
                          <li>You may leave space for your grip if you intend to use the pen for writing rather than display.</li>
